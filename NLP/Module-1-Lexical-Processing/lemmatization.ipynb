      "the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or\n",

      "âwithout pictures or conversations?â\n",
      "\n",
      "So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the\n",
      "hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of\n",
      "making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and\n",
      "picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran\n",
      "close by her.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it\n",
      "so _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, âOh\n",
      "dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!â (when she thought it over afterwards,\n",
      "it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the\n",
      "time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a\n",
      "watch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried\n",
      "on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she\n",
      "had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a\n",
      "watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\n",
      "field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a\n",
      "large rabbit-hole under the hedge.\n",
      "\n",
      "In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\n",
      "in the world she was to get out again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\n",
      "dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\n",
      "about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very\n",
      "deep well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\n",
      "plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what\n",
      "was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out\n",
      "what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\n",
      "looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\n",
      "cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures\n",
      "hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she\n",
      "passed; it was labelled âORANGE MARMALADEâ, but to her great\n",
      "disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear\n",
      "of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the\n",
      "cupboards as she fell past it.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWell!â thought Alice to herself, âafter such a fall as this, I shall\n",
      "think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave theyâll all think me\n",
      "at home! Why, I wouldnât say anything about it, even if I fell off the\n",
      "top of the house!â (Which was very likely true.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Down, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? âI wonder how\n",
      "many miles Iâve fallen by this time?â she said aloud. âI must be\n",
      "getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would\n",
      "be four thousand miles down, I thinkââ (for, you see, Alice had learnt\n",
      "several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and\n",
      "though this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her\n",
      "knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good\n",
      "practice to say it over) ââyes, thatâs about the right distanceâbut\n",
      "then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude Iâve got to?â (Alice had no\n",
      "idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice\n",
      "grand words to say.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently she began again. âI wonder if I shall fall right _through_\n",
      "the earth! How funny itâll seem to come out among the people that walk\n",
      "with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I thinkââ (she was rather\n",
      "glad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didnât sound at all\n",
      "the right word) ââbut I shall have to ask them what the name of the\n",
      "country is, you know. Please, Maâam, is this New Zealand or Australia?â\n",
      "(and she tried to curtsey as she spokeâfancy _curtseying_ as youâre\n",
      "falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) âAnd what\n",
      "an ignorant little girl sheâll think me for asking! No, itâll never do\n",
      "to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.â\n",

      "Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began\n",

      "(Dinah was the cat.) âI hope theyâll remember her saucer of milk at\n",
      "tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are\n",
      "no mice in the air, Iâm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and thatâs\n",
      "very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?â And here\n",
      "Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a\n",
      "dreamy sort of way, âDo cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?â and\n",
      "sometimes, âDo bats eat cats?â for, you see, as she couldnât answer\n",
      "either question, it didnât much matter which way she put it. She felt\n",
      "that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was\n",
      "walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,\n",
      "âNow, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?â when suddenly,\n",
      "thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and\n",

      "\n",

      "and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, âOh my ears\n",

      "moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid\n",
      "gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but\n",
      "they were nowhere to be seenâeverything seemed to have changed since\n",

      "By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table\n",
      "in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three\n",
      "pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the\n",
      "gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a\n",
      "little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label\n",
      "this time with the words âDRINK ME,â but nevertheless she uncorked it\n",
      "and put it to her lips. âI know _something_ interesting is sure to\n",
      "happen,â she said to herself, âwhenever I eat or drink anything; so\n",
      "Iâll just see what this bottle does. I do hope itâll make me grow large\n",

      "\n",
      "It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had\n",
      "drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,\n",

      "down the bottle, saying to herself âThatâs quite enoughâI hope I shanât\n",
      "grow any moreâAs it is, I canât get out at the doorâI do wish I hadnât\n",
      "drunk quite so much!â\n",
      "\n",
      "Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,\n",
      "and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there\n",
      "was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with\n",
      "one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.\n",
      "Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out\n",
      "of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself âNow I\n",
      "can do no more, whatever happens. What _will_ become of me?â\n",
      "\n",
      "Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,\n",
      "and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there\n",
      "seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room\n",
      "again, no wonder she felt unhappy.\n",
      "\n",
      "âIt was much pleasanter at home,â thought poor Alice, âwhen one wasnât\n",
      "always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and\n",
      "rabbits. I almost wish I hadnât gone down that rabbit-holeâand yetâand\n",
      "yetâitâs rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what\n",
      "_can_ have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied\n",
      "that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of\n",
      "one! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And\n",
      "when I grow up, Iâll write oneâbut Iâm grown up now,â she added in a\n",
      "sorrowful tone; âat least thereâs no room to grow up any more _here_.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âBut then,â thought Alice, âshall I _never_ get any older than I am\n",
      "now? Thatâll be a comfort, one wayânever to be an old womanâbut\n",
      "thenâalways to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldnât like _that!_â\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh, you foolish Alice!â she answered herself. âHow can you learn\n",

      "for any lesson-books!â\n",
      "\n",
      "And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and\n",

      "she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "âMary Ann! Mary Ann!â said the voice. âFetch me my gloves this moment!â\n",

      "large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.\n",
      "\n",

      "the door opened inwards, and Aliceâs elbow was pressed hard against it,\n",
      "that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself âThen Iâll\n",
      "go round and get in at the window.â\n",
      "\n",
      "â_That_ you wonât!â thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied\n",
      "she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her\n",
      "hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,\n",
      "but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,\n",
      "from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a\n",
      "cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next came an angry voiceâthe RabbitâsââPat! Pat! Where are you?â And\n",

      "âIâm afraid I canât put it more clearly,â Alice replied very politely,\n",

      "after that into a butterfly, I should think youâll feel it a little\n",

      "Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any\n",
      "good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant\n",
      "state of mind, she turned away.\n",
      "\n",
      "âCome back!â the Caterpillar called after her. âIâve something\n",

      "its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, âSo you\n",

      "\n",
      "âI _donât_ know,â said the Caterpillar.\n",

      "\n",
      "âWell, I should like to be a _little_ larger, sir, if you wouldnât\n",
      "mind,â said Alice: âthree inches is such a wretched height to be.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âIt is a very good height indeed!â said the Caterpillar angrily,\n",
      "rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).\n",

      "âBut Iâm not used to it!â pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she\n",

      "offended!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYouâll get used to it in time,â said the Caterpillar; and it put the\n",
      "hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.\n",
      "\n",
      "This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a\n",
      "minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and\n",
      "yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the\n",
      "mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,\n",
      "âOne side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you\n",
      "grow shorter.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âOne side of _what?_ The other side of _what?_â thought Alice to\n",
      "herself.\n",

      "aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.\n",

      "Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute,\n",
      "trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was\n",

      "last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke\n",
      "off a bit of the edge with each hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAnd now which is which?â she said to herself, and nibbled a little of\n",
      "the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a\n",
      "violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!\n",
      "\n",
      "She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt\n",
      "that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she\n",
      "set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed\n",
      "so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her\n",
      "mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the\n",

      "As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head,\n",
      "she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that\n",
      "her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She\n",
      "had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was\n",
      "going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but\n",
      "the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp\n",
      "hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her\n",

      "tone, and added with a kind of sob, âIâve tried every way, and nothing\n",

      "\n",
      "âIâm very sorry youâve been annoyed,â said Alice, who was beginning to\n",

      "âAnd just as Iâd taken the highest tree in the wood,â continued the\n",

      "\n",
      "âA likely story indeed!â said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest\n",
      "contempt. âIâve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never\n",
      "_one_ with such a neck as that! No, no! Youâre a serpent; and thereâs\n",
      "no use denying it. I suppose youâll be telling me next that you never\n",

      "\n",
      "âI _have_ tasted eggs, certainly,â said Alice, who was a very truthful\n",

      "\n",
      "This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a\n",
      "minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, âYouâre\n",

      "\n",
      "âWell, be off, then!â said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled\n",
      "down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well\n",
      "as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches,\n",
      "and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while\n",
      "she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands,\n",
      "and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at\n",

      "It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it\n",

      "and began talking to herself, as usual. âCome, thereâs half my plan\n",
      "done now! How puzzling all these changes are! Iâm never sure what Iâm\n",
      "going to be, from one minute to another! However, Iâve got back to my\n",
      "right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful gardenâhow\n",
      "_is_ that to be done, I wonder?â As she said this, she came suddenly\n",
      "upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.\n",
      "âWhoever lives there,â thought Alice, âitâll never do to come upon them\n",
      "_this_ size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!â So she\n",

      "For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what\n",

      "woodâ(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:\n",
      "otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a\n",

      "another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a\n",
      "frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled\n",
      "all over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all\n",

      "\n",
      "The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,\n",

      "An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.â\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood\n",
      "for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the\n",
      "Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the\n",
      "door, staring stupidly up into the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThereâs no sort of use in knocking,â said the Footman, âand that for\n",
      "two reasons. First, because Iâm on the same side of the door as you\n",
      "are; secondly, because theyâre making such a noise inside, no one could\n",
      "possibly hear you.â And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary\n",
      "noise going on withinâa constant howling and sneezing, and every now\n",
      "and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to\n",
      "pieces.\n",
      "\n",
      "âPlease, then,â said Alice, âhow am I to get in?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âThere might be some sense in your knocking,â the Footman went on\n",
      "without attending to her, âif we had the door between us. For instance,\n",
      "if you were _inside_, you might knock, and I could let you out, you\n",
      "know.â He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and\n",
      "this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. âBut perhaps he canât help it,â\n",
      "she said to herself; âhis eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his\n",
      "head. But at any rate he might answer questions.âHow am I to get in?â\n",
      "she repeated, aloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI shall sit here,â the Footman remarked, âtill tomorrowââ\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came\n",
      "skimming out, straight at the Footmanâs head: it just grazed his nose,\n",
      "and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.\n",
      "\n",
      "ââor next day, maybe,â the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly\n",
      "as if nothing had happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHow am I to get in?â asked Alice again, in a louder tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "â_Are_ you to get in at all?â said the Footman. âThatâs the first\n",
      "question, you know.â\n",
      "\n",
      "It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. âItâs really\n",

      "Itâs enough to drive one crazy!â\n",
      "\n",
      "The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his\n",

      "days and days.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âBut what am _I_ to do?â said Alice.\n",

      "\n",
      "âOh, thereâs no use in talking to him,â said Alice desperately: âheâs\n",
      "perfectly idiotic!â And she opened the door and went in.\n",
      "\n",
      "The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from\n",
      "one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool\n",
      "in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire,\n",
      "stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThereâs certainly too much pepper in that soup!â Alice said to\n",
      "herself, as well as she could for sneezing.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed\n",
      "occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling\n",
      "alternately without a momentâs pause. The only things in the kitchen\n",
      "that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting\n",
      "on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "âPlease would you tell me,â said Alice, a little timidly, for she was\n",
      "not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, âwhy\n",
      "your cat grins like that?â\n",
      "\n",

      "She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite\n",
      "jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the\n",

      "\n",
      "âI didnât know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didnât\n",
      "know that cats _could_ grin.â\n",

      "\n",
      "Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would\n",
      "be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she\n",
      "was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the\n",
      "fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at\n",
      "the Duchess and the babyâthe fire-irons came first; then followed a\n",
      "shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of\n",
      "them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,\n",
      "that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh, _please_ mind what youâre doing!â cried Alice, jumping up and down\n",
      "in an agony of terror. âOh, there goes his _precious_ nose!â as an\n",
      "unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it\n",
      "off.\n",
      "\n",
      "âIf everybody minded their own business,â the Duchess said in a hoarse\n",
      "growl, âthe world would go round a deal faster than it does.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhich would _not_ be an advantage,â said Alice, who felt very glad to\n",
      "get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. âJust\n",
      "think of what work it would make with the day and night! You see the\n",

      "Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take\n",
      "the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to\n",
      "be listening, so she went on again: âTwenty-four hours, I _think_; or\n",
      "is it twelve? Iââ\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh, donât bother _me_,â said the Duchess; âI never could abide\n",

      "sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at\n",
      "the end of every line:\n",
      "\n",

      "out into the open air. âIf I donât take this child away with me,â\n",
      "thought Alice, âtheyâre sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldnât it be\n",

      "not like the look of the thing at all. âBut perhaps it was only\n",
      "sobbing,â she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there\n",
      "were any tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "No, there were no tears. âIf youâre going to turn into a pig, my dear,â\n",

      "now!â The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible\n",
      "to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was just beginning to think to herself, âNow, what am I to do\n",
      "with this creature when I get it home?â when it grunted again, so\n",
      "violently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time\n",
      "there could be _no_ mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than\n",
      "a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it\n",
      "further.\n",
      "\n",

      "rather a handsome pig, I think.â And she began thinking over other\n",
      "children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying\n",
      "to herself, âif one only knew the right way to change themââ when she\n",

      "\n",
      "The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she\n",

      "âNot the same thing a bit!â said the Hatter. âYou might just as well\n",

      "writing-desks, which wasnât much.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hatter was the first to break the silence. âWhat day of the month\n",

      "and holding it to his ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice considered a little, and then said âThe fourth.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âTwo days wrong!â sighed the Hatter. âI told you butter wouldnât suit\n",

      "\n",

      "tell what oâclock it is!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhy should it?â muttered the Hatter. âDoes _your_ watch tell you what\n",

      "\n",
      "âAh! that accounts for it,â said the Hatter. âHe wonât stand beating.\n",
      "Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, heâd do almost anything\n",
      "you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine oâclock in\n",
      "the morning, just time to begin lessons: youâd only have to whisper a\n",
      "hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,\n",
      "time for dinner!â\n",
      "\n",
      "(âI only wish it was,â the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)\n",
      "\n",
      "âThat would be grand, certainly,â said Alice thoughtfully: âbut thenâI\n",

      "\n",
      "âNot at first, perhaps,â said the Hatter: âbut you could keep it to\n",

      "with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) ââit was at the great concert\n",

      "that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,\n",

      "\n",
      "âEverybody says âcome on!â here,â thought Alice, as she went slowly\n",

      "nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She\n",
      "pitied him deeply. âWhat is his sorrow?â she asked the Gryphon, and the\n",

      "his fancy, that: he hasnât got no sorrow, you know. Come on!â\n",
      "\n",
      "So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes\n",
      "full of tears, but said nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThis here young lady,â said the Gryphon, âshe wants for to know your\n",
      "history, she do.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âIâll tell it her,â said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: âsit\n",
      "down, both of you, and donât speak a word till Iâve finished.â\n",
      "\n",
      "So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to\n",
      "herself, âI donât see how he can _ever_ finish, if he doesnât begin.â\n",
      "But she waited patiently.\n",
      "\n",

      "Turtle.â\n",
      "\n",
      "These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an\n",
      "occasional exclamation of âHjckrrh!â from the Gryphon, and the constant\n",
      "heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and\n",
      "saying, âThank you, sir, for your interesting story,â but she could not\n",
      "help thinking there _must_ be more to come, so she sat still and said\n",

      "\n",
      "âWhen we were little,â the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,\n",
      "though still sobbing a little now and then, âwe went to school in the\n",
      "sea. The master was an old Turtleâwe used to call him Tortoiseââ\n",

      "\n",
      "âYou ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple\n",
      "question,â added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked\n",

      "Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, âDrive on, old fellow! Donât be all\n",
      "day about it!â and he went on in these words:\n",
      "\n",

      "âAh! then yours wasnât a really good school,â said the Mock Turtle in a\n",
      "tone of great relief. âNow at _ours_ they had at the end of the bill,\n",
